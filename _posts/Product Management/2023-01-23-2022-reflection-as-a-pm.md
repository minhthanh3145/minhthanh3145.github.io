# 2022 reflection as a product manager
## Introduction

2022 was very liberating for me. I moved out and got a place of my own. As a result of the newfound freedom, I determined to take on many new professional commitments and was able to achieve many things that I previously had never thought of. Along the way, I made new relationships that imbued my life with a lot of meanings.

These statements probably sound very generic without context. What you need to know is that, my early twenties were spent on professional development. Partly because I wanted to see how far I could go if I just do one thing really well. But mostly because I was in a tough place, both mentally and otherwise. So I figured that only by gaining a certain degree of financial freedom could I achieve a similar kind of freedom of the mind. Ultimately I was right. 

But all decisions have trade-offs (finally I sound like a Product Manager). I didn't have a life outside of work. I didn't focus on my physical health. I had (and still have) a very poor sense of fashion. I didn't have time to build meaningful relationships. But all in all, it was all worth it.

## Make it easy to do simple things

Sometimes when you're leading a product within a platform, the thing that can impact your product the most lies outside of your product. This is particularly even more important when your product is technically complicated and hard to explain, such as a cloud infrastructure system, you have to touch on user journeys that span across several modules to make people even know that your product exists.

In product management, what can bring about impacts can be so simple that it sounds dumb to just say it out loud. But that is precisely why you should take simple ideas seriously. Putting a concept or an idea into practice and observing its implications is important in a complex domain.

Earlier this year I was concerned with launching a new product and its Go-to-market movement. Several months after launching, we sat down to review what was the most important thing to work on that could unblock growth. At the time, the product's presence was weak within the platform, and its activation wasn't high. Now, its weak presence and low activation rate could have been unrelated, but I made a hypothesis that one is reflective of another.

Sharing that hypothesis with the team, I got buy-ins from PMs of other modules to change the platform's onboarding flow to lead users to an action that would use my product underneath. The monthly usage increases almost quadruple, and ARR also showed significant increase. In hindsight, it was obvious, but at the time I surely didn't know that the bet would pay off.

I think what made me more willing to follow through was that we used a tool that allows us to dynamically adjust the onboarding flow on the fly. It made experimenting more probable. I initially disliked the tool because I thought it steered us away from focusing on improving the UI/UX of the products. Now I look back and think that it was the right to at the right time, because it provided a quick way to demonstrate that improving activation is worth it and perhaps we should invest on improving the UI/UX itself to further increase activation.

To summarize, I'd like to borrow a principle from the manufacturing world: 

> Lower the transaction cost, and you would make it more economically sensible to work in small batches. 

Or in a more PM-friendly language, lower the cost of doing experiments by using tools that let you modify parts of the products easily, and you would be more naturally inclined to do more experiments. Sometimes, a quick experiment can produce a quick win that justifies experiments that are more costly, particularly if you're in a more conservative environment.

# But even if it's difficult, try to do simple things
Taking simple ideas seriously and consistently can create a lot of impact. But the difficulty comes from the fact that everything in a company is situated within organizational, interpersonal and personal constrains that are reflective of the reality in which it manifests. Perhaps your company isn't one with an aculture of learning through trial-and-error in its DNA. Perhaps your product and engineering departments don't get along with one another and that makes shipping minimum viable changes difficult. Perhaps you don't feel like you want to learn to navigate organizational complexity and politics at this point in your career. To make it more complicated, all of these things may happen at once.

But even if it's difficult, if your goal is to create impact, then you need to re-focus your
