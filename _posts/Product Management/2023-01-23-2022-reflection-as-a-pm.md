## Make it easy to do simple things

Sometimes when you're leading a product within a platform, the thing that can impact your product the most lies outside of your product. This is particularly even more important when your product is technically complicated and hard to explain, such as a cloud infrastructure system, you have to touch on user journeys that span across several modules to make people even know that your product exists.

In product management, what can bring about impacts can be so simple that it sounds dumb to just say it out loud. But that is precisely why you should take simple ideas seriously. Putting a concept or an idea into practice and observing its implications is important in a complex domain.

Earlier this year I was concerned with launching a new product and its Go-to-market movement. Several months after launching, we sat down to review what was the most important thing to work on that could unblock growth. At the time, the product's presence was weak within the platform, and its activation wasn't high. Now, its weak presence and low activation rate could have been unrelated, but I made a hypothesis that one is reflective of another.

Sharing that hypothesis with the team, I got buy-ins from PMs of other modules to change the platform's onboarding flow to lead users to an action that would use my product underneath. The monthly usage increases almost quadruple, and ARR also showed significant increase. In hindsight, it was obvious, but at the time I surely didn't know that the bet would pay off.

I think what made me more willing to follow through was that we used a tool that allows us to dynamically adjust the onboarding flow on the fly. It made experimenting easier. I initially disliked the tool because I thought it steered our focus away from improving the UI/UX of the products. Now I look back and think that it was the right too,l at the right time, because it was a quick way to demonstrate that improving activation is worth it, and we should maybe invest on improving the UI/UX to further increase activation.

To summarize, I'd like to borrow a principle from the manufacturing world: 

> Lower the transaction cost, and you would make it more economically sensible to work in small batches

Or in a more PM-friendly language, lower the cost of doing experiments by using tools that let you modify parts of the products easily, and you would be more naturally inclined to do more experiments. Sometimes, a quick experiment can produce a quick win that justifies more costly experiments, especially if you're in a more conservative environment. And experiments sound heavy. They're not. They're often very simple things that we think can work. Make it easy to do simple things.

## But even if it's difficult, focus your resources on doing simple things

Taking simple ideas seriously can create a lot of impact. But the difficulty comes from the fact that everything in a company is situated within organizational, interpersonal and personal constrains that are reflective of the reality in which it manifests. Perhaps your company isn't one with an a a culture of learning through trial-and-error in its DNA. Perhaps your product and engineering departments don't get along with one another and that makes shipping minimum viable changes difficult. Perhaps you don't feel like you want to learn to navigate organizational complexity and politics at this point in your career. To make it more complicated, all of these things may happen at once.

But if your goal is to create impact, then you need to do simple things anyway. In fact, I'd argue that in an organization with more constraints, focusing on doing simple things would help you create more impact compared to others since their thinking would likely be imbued with organizational complexity and thus lose focus on simple ideas.

An example is as I mentioned above: improving the onboarding flow to guide people to the Aha moment better. As an avid reader and a product manager, I am aware how obvious that statement sounds. There are a lot of practical questions you have to answer. Some are essential such as "what is the definition of your Aha moment?". But honestly? Just pick your best guess and go with it. Then learn from data and iterate again. That is a very generic advice, but I must admit that my definition of Aha moment was ridiculously simple. Yet after several iterations on onboarding flow, we obtained great results. 

I realize that my view may be biased towards those who work in more complex organizations. Perhaps in companies where trial-and-error is warmly welcomed and failures are treated as learnings, or in places where you can easily get alignment from top-to-bottom, you would rightful be more concerned with the nuances of particular ideas and insights. But my bias is that it's often not the case. Most organizations are complex.
