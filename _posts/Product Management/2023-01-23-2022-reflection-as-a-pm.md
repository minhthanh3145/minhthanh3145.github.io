Hi there, thank you for being here, at this point in time and space.

I spent the past few days thinking about what I've learned over the past year. In 2021, I stretched my thinking on thorny topics such as [product strategy](https://minhthanh3145.github.io/my-take-on-product-strategy), [enabling context](https://minhthanh3145.github.io/get-everyone-out-of-the-building-or-how-product-managers-are-like-fire-fighters) and [synthesizing how frameworks may be combined](https://minhthanh3145.github.io/how-product-development-frameworks-work-together-to-enable-actions). But I didn't write a single blog post in 2022, because I wanted to move away from abstraction and synthesis and get closer to more simple ideas. So far, I've been able to take some simple ideas very seriously. I'd like to use this blog post to ruminate on such thoughts, which hopefully are going to be helpful to you.

## Make it easy to do simple things

When you're working within a platform, the most impactful thing may lie outside your direct area of authority, especially when the product is technical and without a user interface (e.g a cloud infrastructure system). You may have to touch on user journeys that span across different modules in the platform to make people even aware that your product exists.

Earlier this year, I was concerned with launching a new product within our platform and facilitating its GTM movement. Several months later, we sat down to review what were the leverage points that could unblock growth. The product's presence within the platform was weak, and its activation rate wasn't satisfying. Admittedly, these two things could have been unrelated, but I made a hypothesis that they were related: If people don't know about a product, naturally they would be activated.

I shared the hypothesis with the team and got buy-ins from other PMs to change the platform's onboarding flow to one that guides users to perform a core action in my product. The monthly usage increased almost four times. And ARR showed a significant increase. Some might even say that it was obviously going to work. But to me, it definitely wasn't obvious until we observed the result.

What made me more willing to act on the bet was that the ability to dynamically adjust the onboarding flow on the fly (using a tool). It made experimenting much cheaper. I was initially worried that the use of such tool would steer us away from optimizing the UI/UX itself. But it helped demonstrate quickly that tapping into what we thought were leverage points was really working.

To summarize, I'd like to borrow a principle from the manufacturing world: 

> [Lower the transaction cost, and you would make it more economically sensible to work in small batches](https://zsoltfabok.com/blog/2013/03/the-optimal-batch-size/)

Or in a more PM-friendly language, lower the cost of doing experiments by using tools that let you modify parts of the products easily, and you would be more naturally inclined to do more experiments. Sometimes, a quick experiment can produce a quick win that justifies more costly experiments, especially if you're in a more conservative environment. And experiments sound heavy. They're not. They're often very simple things that we think can work. Make it easy to do simple things.


## But even when it's difficult, focus on doing simple things anyway

Taking simple ideas seriously can be the path to huge impacts. But the difficulty comes from the fact that everything in a company is situated within organizational, interpersonal and personal constrains that are reflective of the reality in which it manifests.

Perhaps your company isn't one with a culture of trial-and-error. Perhaps your product and engineering departments don't get along with one another, which makes shipping minimum viable changes difficult. Perhaps you don't feel like you want to learn to navigate organizational complexity and politics at this point in your career. Or all of these things may happen at the same thing.

But you need to do simple things anyway. In fact, I'd argue that in an organization with more constraints, doing simple things would create more impact because the collective mind would likely be imbued with organizational complexity and thus lose focus on simple ideas.

Take the above example: improve the onboarding flow and activation increases. As an avid reader and a product manager, I am aware of how obvious that sounds. There are a lot of practical questions you have to answer. Some are essential questions, like "what is the definition of your Aha moment?". But in all honesty, just pick your best guess and go with it. Then learn from data and iterate again. My initial definition of Aha moment was ridiculously simple. But after just a handful of iterations, we got great results.

A few months ago, we decided to improve a particular dialog within the platform that people use to schedule their tests (our product is a software quality platform). After examining historical data and the user journey when they first come to the platform, we determined that a huge friction point would be when users schedule their first tests. The old dialog induced small but numerous cognitive loads on the users to complete the task. Our bet was that reducing these cognitive loads would mean a higher task completion rate and thus a higher activation rate.

But scheduling tests is something people would use a lot throughout their adoption. Plus, many functionalities on that dialog belong to other modules owned by other product managers. And my team were not the original owner of the dialog. These factors amount to a certain degree of reluctance. We had to pitch our hypothesis to other teams to get them to see that the problem was worth solving.

We were able to get buy-in from other product managers to proceed. The product designer was given the problem statement, business constraints (time, what problem we will not solve, etc.) and, most importantly, the freedom in crafting solutions. A handful of prototypes were created and reviewed together. Ultimately, we settled on a version that addresses the most important problems in the original design.

In order to de-risk the experiment, the dialog was rolled out to just 20% of our new users. It helped us detect issues in a controlled manner. Early signals showed that both completion rate and time on task were improved. We rolled it out to 50% of new users. The task completion rate almost doubled, and users on average complete the task 10 seconds faster using the new dialog. It was a clear win.

## Conclusion

2022 was a great year for me, both professionally and personally. I think taking simple ideas very seriously was very impactful to my career. I've come to embrace more the complexity and uncertainty of product management, while developing and enriching mental models  based on both experiences and absorbing other people's works.

Furthermore, I've grown a lot in a short period of time. Next year, I want to aim at creating sustainable infrastructures around my work so that I can support myself and other people better as a product manager. 

It has been a great year. Until we meet again!
