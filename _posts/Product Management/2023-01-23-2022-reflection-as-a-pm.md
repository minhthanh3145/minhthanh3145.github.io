## Make it easy to do simple things

When you're leading a product within a platform, the most impactful thing may lie outside of your product. This is more true when your product is technical and hard to explain in laymen terms, such as a cloud infrastructure system. You have to touch on user journeys that span across several modules to make people even aware that your product exists.

Earlier this year I was concerned with launching a new product and its GTM movement. Several months after launching, we sat down to review unblockers for growth. At the time, the product's presence was weak within the platform and its activation wasn't particularly satisfying. These two things could have been unrelated, but I made a hypothesis that one is related to another. If people don't know about it, naturally they would not use it.

I shared the hypothesis with the team and got buy-ins from other PMs to change the platform's onboarding flow to one that guides users to perform a core action in my product. The monthly usage increased almost quadruple, and ARR also showed significant increase. In hindsight, it was obvious. But at the time it wasn't obvious at all that the bet would pay off.

I was more willing to follow through with the bet because we could dynamically adjust the onboarding flow on the fly (using a tool). It made experimenting much cheaper. I initially disliked the tool because I thought it would steer our focus away from improving the product itself. Now I look back and think that it was the right tool at the right time. It helped demonstrate quickly that improving activation is worth it, and we should invest more on improving the UI/UX to further increase activation.

To summarize, I'd like to borrow a principle from the manufacturing world: 

> Lower the transaction cost, and you would make it more economically sensible to work in small batches

Or in a more PM-friendly language, lower the cost of doing experiments by using tools that let you modify parts of the products easily, and you would be more naturally inclined to do more experiments. Sometimes, a quick experiment can produce a quick win that justifies more costly experiments, especially if you're in a more conservative environment. And experiments sound heavy. They're not. They're often very simple things that we think can work. Make it easy to do simple things.

## But even when it's difficult, focus on doing simple things

Taking simple ideas seriously can create a lot of impact. But the difficulty comes from the fact that everything in a company is situated within organizational, interpersonal and personal constrains that are reflective of the reality in which it manifests. 

Perhaps your company isn't one with a culture of trial-and-error. Perhaps your product and engineering departments don't get along with one another which makes shipping minimum viable changes difficult. Perhaps you don't feel like you want to learn to navigate organizational complexity and politics at this point in your career. Or all of these things may happen at the same thing.

But you need to do simple things anyway. In fact, I'd argue that in an organization with more constraints, doing simple things would create more impact because the collective mind would likely be imbued with organizational complexity and thus lose focus on simple ideas.

Take the above example: improve the onboarding flow and activation increases. As an avid reader and a product manager, I am aware of how obvious that sounds. There are a lot of practical questions you have to answer. Some are essential questions, like "what is the definition of your Aha moment?". But in all honesty, just pick your best guess and go with it. Then learn from data and iterate again. My initial definition of Aha moment was ridiculously simple. But after just a handful of iterations, we got great results. 

My view may resonate more with those who work in complex organizations where getting things done is not straightforward. Perhaps in companies where trial-and-error is part of the DNA and failures are celebrated as learnings, or in places where you can easily get alignment from top-to-bottom, you would be more concerned with the particularities. But many organizations are more complex than that.

Another instance of taking simple ideas seriously is enabling your product designers to do their best work. As a product manager, I'm very involved in the product discovery process. But I don't have the expertise required to directly create a delightful user interface. Product designers are uniquely positioned to solve the "usable" aspect of a product. While the impact of usability is often difficult to measure quantitatively, the feeling that you have built something you'd enjoy using is a direct result of good usability.

It's a great thing when the majority of people in an organization are aligned on the importance of UX. But such alignment mustn't be based on just abstract understanding. It must be based on the organization collectively experiencing consequences of bad UX or positive results of good UX.
