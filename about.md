Hi there, I am Thomas, I am an aspiring product developer with 3-years experience of software development.

I have taken on various roles and participated in a lot of aspects of product development:

- **Product Manager**: Research, proposed, implemented features, requirements and UX that maximize customer satisfactions and KPIs.
- **Product Researcher**: Organize and implement participant recruitment strategy and conduct user interviews to discover Persona and Job-to-be-done.
- **Product Expert**: Helped Enterprises adopt our tools formally through leading, designing technical training courses.
- **Data Analyst**: Evaluated features' usefulness by conducting qualitative (survey, interviews) and quantitative analysis (cohort analysis).

Outside of work, I maintain some side-projects at [Github](https://github.com/minhthanh3145)
