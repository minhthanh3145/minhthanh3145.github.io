Hi there, I am Thomas. Nice to meet you.

As you probably already know from the home page, I am a product manager with experience in B2B SaaS companies. [Here is my Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thanh-minh-to/) if you want to view my professional profile. But this page isn't about showcasing that.

I studied Computer Science, so naturally I started my career as a software engineer. I've got the opportunity to work on an Eclipse desktop application for 3 years before transitioning into product management. Although it wasn't that long, I was able to dive deeply into the world of software development (to the degree that one can within 3 years. That intense experience made me appreciate how complex a piece of software can be.

I thoroughly enjoyed solving the puzzle, but at some points I realized that I was only solving the puzzle someone else handed to me. I wanted to solve puzzules that make people's lives better. A software engineer isn't uniquely in a position to create the biggest impact in that regards. And I don't mean to say that a software engineer cannot do it, it's just that a software engineer must first and foremost focus on the craft of creating and maintaining software, so in a sense the role wasn't designed to achieve the purpose that I want to pursue. So that's why I became a product manager. So far, I have found the role very fulfilling and engaging.
